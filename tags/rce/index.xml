&lt;p&gt;In this post, we give technical details about a chain of vulnerabilities we identified that can be triggered by downloading a malicious Audible audiobook, allowing to take full control of the device and its registered Amazon account.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Achieving Remote Code Execution in Steam: a journey into the Remote Play protocol</title><link>/posts/achieving-remote-code-execution-in-steam-remote-play/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Dec 2023 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/achieving-remote-code-execution-in-steam-remote-play/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remote Play Together&lt;/em&gt;, developed by Valve, allows sharing local multi-player games with friends over the network through streaming. The associated protocol is elaborate enough to shelter a valuable attack surface that has scarcely been ventured into in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post covers the reverse engineering of the protocol and client/server implementations inside Steam, before presenting a dedicated fuzzer that unveiled a few critical vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Remote Deserialization Bug in Microsoft's RDP Client through Smart Card Extension (CVE-2021-38666)</title><link>/posts/deserialization-bug-through-rdp-smart-card-extension/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 06:00:01 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/deserialization-bug-through-rdp-smart-card-extension/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;strong&gt;third installment&lt;/strong&gt; in my three-part series of articles on fuzzing Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s RDP client, where I explain a bug I found by fuzzing the &lt;strong&gt;smart card extension&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
