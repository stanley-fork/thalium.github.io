In this post, we cover the work done during an internship on developing an &lt;strong&gt;automated devirtualization tool&lt;/strong&gt;. We explore a simplified taint-based approach and discuss its limitations. For a more in-depth analysis, the full report is also made available.</description></item><item><title>Achieving Remote Code Execution in Steam: a journey into the Remote Play protocol</title><link>/posts/achieving-remote-code-execution-in-steam-remote-play/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Dec 2023 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/achieving-remote-code-execution-in-steam-remote-play/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remote Play Together&lt;/em&gt;, developed by Valve, allows sharing local multi-player games with friends over the network through streaming. The associated protocol is elaborate enough to shelter a valuable attack surface that has scarcely been ventured into in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post covers the reverse engineering of the protocol and client/server implementations inside Steam, before presenting a dedicated fuzzer that unveiled a few critical vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>ECW 2023: kaleidoscope (write-up)</title><link>/posts/ecw-2023-kaleidoscope-write-up/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/ecw-2023-kaleidoscope-write-up/</guid><description>&lt;strong&gt;kaleidoscope&lt;/strong&gt; was a hard reverse engineering challenge created for the European Cyber Week CTF 2023 qualifiers, with a focus on Windows-specific mechanisms and VM-based obfuscation.</description></item><item><title>ECW 2021 - WriteUp</title><link>/posts/ecw2021-writeup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Oct 2021 12:00:01 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/ecw2021-writeup/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;a href="https://www.european-cyber-week.eu/"&gt;European Cyber Week&lt;/a&gt; CTF 2021 Thalium created some challenges in our core competencies: reverse and exploitation. This blog post presents some of the write-ups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#chest"&gt;Chest (36 solve) - reverse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#fsb-as-a-service"&gt;FSB as a service (3 solve) - exploitation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#wysiwyg"&gt;WYSIWYG (3 solve) - reverse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pipe Dream (1 solve) - reverse
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the author posted his solution on &lt;a href="https://face.0xff.re/posts/ecw-ctf-2021-pipe-dream-writeup/"&gt;his personal blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thalium&amp;rsquo;s challenges have been less resolved than others. They were not that difficult, but probably a bit more unexpected. A few additional challenges designed by Thalium are:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
