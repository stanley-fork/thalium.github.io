&lt;p&gt;In this post, we give technical details about a chain of vulnerabilities we identified that can be triggered by downloading a malicious Audible audiobook, allowing to take full control of the device and its registered Amazon account.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Achieving Remote Code Execution in Steam: a journey into the Remote Play protocol</title><link>/posts/achieving-remote-code-execution-in-steam-remote-play/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Dec 2023 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/achieving-remote-code-execution-in-steam-remote-play/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remote Play Together&lt;/em&gt;, developed by Valve, allows sharing local multi-player games with friends over the network through streaming. The associated protocol is elaborate enough to shelter a valuable attack surface that has scarcely been ventured into in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post covers the reverse engineering of the protocol and client/server implementations inside Steam, before presenting a dedicated fuzzer that unveiled a few critical vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Rooting Xiaomi WiFi Routers</title><link>/posts/rooting-xiaomi-wifi-routers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/rooting-xiaomi-wifi-routers/</guid><description>In this article, we discuss our research approach for investigating Xiaomi routers. We discovered multiple vulnerabilities allowing Remote Code Execution (RCE) on several models, through both LAN and WAN interfaces. This work led to the publication of four CVEs specifically targeting Xiaomi routers.</description></item><item><title>Leveraging Android Permissions: A Solver Approach</title><link>/posts/leveraging-android-permissions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/leveraging-android-permissions/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The Android permission management system has already suffered from several vulnerabilities in the past. Such weaknesses can grant dangerous permissions to a malevolent application, an example being &lt;code&gt;CALL_LOG&lt;/code&gt;, which gives access to all incoming and outgoing calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post dives into the Android permission system and how a solver was leveraged to find new vulnerabilities. With this approach, a privilege escalation was identified, which was fixed and assigned CVE-2023-20947 by Google.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>kSMBd: a quick overview</title><link>/posts/ksmbd-trailer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/ksmbd-trailer/</guid><description>In this blogpost, we introduce the analysis of one SMB implementation: kSMBd.

All these additions represent an extra attack surface that can change from one phone model to another. We tried to automatically fuzz the closed-source system services powering these modifications, discovering &lt;code&gt;CVE-2022-39907&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CVE-2022-39908&lt;/code&gt; along the way.</description></item><item><title>ARM TrustZone: pivoting to the secure world</title><link>/posts/pivoting_to_the_secure_world/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Mar 2023 13:37:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/pivoting_to_the_secure_world/</guid><description>&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Exploitation to get code execution in a trusted driver, while not having a debugger for this obscure environment&lt;/li&gt;
